	"data": true
}
```
### Failure example
```json
{
	"error": true,
	"message": "Error_Message",
	"data": false
}
```

## Usage

```swift
do {
    let responseData = try await Services.initSession(
        client_id: "your_client_id",
        client_key: "your_client_key"
    )
    // Process the session-related data in JSON format.
} catch {
    // Handle any errors that may occur during the request.
